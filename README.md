# **Cyber Threat Detection System**

This project is a **React + Vite** based frontend integrated with a **Python (Flask)** backend to detect cyber threats like **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** using **Trie-based pattern matching** and **Finite Automata for Matching String**. It provides a simple and interactive interface where users can enter suspicious input and receive real-time feedback on potential security issues.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to raise awareness and provide hands-on understanding of common cyber attacks by demonstrating how malicious patterns like SQLi or XSS can be detected at the input level. The backend uses a custom-built **Trie data structure** to match inputs against known attack signatures.
